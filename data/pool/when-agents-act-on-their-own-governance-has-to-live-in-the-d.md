summary: 'Presented by EDB     As enterprises give AI agents more autonomy — the ability to plan, decide,
  and act across systems without a human approving each step — a hard question moves to the center of
  every architecture review: When an agent tries to complete an action that it was never authorized to
  do, what actually stops it?  These are your agents, running on your models, touching your data in your
  infrastructure — and the responsibility for what they do sits with you. That responsibility can’t be
  met in hindsight or with a set of abstract policies that live on paper but not in practice. Agents need
  rules in the context of the moment, because they don’t exercise overriding judgment of their own actions.  Consider
  a simple rule: Never open the car door. Followed literally, an agent could never get in or out of the
  car at all. But if you change the context (the car has just crashed, there’s a fire, someone is hurt
  and needs to get out), then the rule you actually want is the opposite. Context in the moment is everything.
  We are asking agents to do intelligent things; that requires intelligent rules.  The instinct is to
  add guardrails around the agent: instructions, policies, and monitoring layered above the model. Those
  mechanisms matter, but they share a structural limit: The car-door rule is plausible right up until
  the moment you actually have to decide whether to open the door. Controls at the agent layer are only
  as reliable as the agent’s output is predictable, and autonomy is precisely the property that makes
  that output hard to predict. Governance that depends on reviewing an action before it happens cannot
  keep pace with a system that acts in milliseconds, across many systems at once.  Governance has to become  executable
